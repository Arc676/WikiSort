# WikiSort datasets

## Command line arguments

The common code base parses command line arguments when running the test programs. The following options are available.

- `-m MAX_LEN` set the maximum array length to test (inclusive) (default 1000)
- `-s START_LEN` set the starting array length (default 100)
- `-i LEN_INC` set the amount by which the array should grow; if linear growth is set, the length increases by this much every time, otherwise the length is scaled up by this amount (default 100)
- `-e` enables exponential array length growth, thus disabling linear growth (default linear growth)
- `-t NUM_TRIALS` sets the number of trials to run for each array length before computing an average (default 10)
- `-o OUTPUT` sets the filename of the output file; this flag *must* be set

## Description

The data included in the repository was generated by timing the execution of sorting algorithms on arrays.

| Filename | Description |
| --- | --- |
| ID.ods |  This test, which used random data, shows that on the x86 Intel i7 chip in a mid-2012 MacBook Pro, double comparison turns out to be faster than integer comparison. The integer and double lists contained elements with the same integral portion. The elements in the double list also included two decimal places. |
| IHQ.ods, IHQ 2.ods | This test used random data and compared the runtime of introsort, heapsort, and quicksort. The introsort algorithm uses both the two other sorting algorithms' techniques. The data shows that heapsort is much slower for large data sets while introsort isn't much faster than quicksort. |
| Shell Gaps.ods | This test used random data and compared the runtime of Shellsort using different gap sequences. The data shows that the single formula sequence described by Sedgewick in 1986 is the fastest in these experimental conditions. It also shows that the two sequences described by Pratt in 1971 are by far the slowest of all the gap sequences under these circumstances. Note that the program tests all the gap sequences. As of this writing, the sequence described by Incerpi and Sedgewick is unimplemented and the generated data is invalid. |
