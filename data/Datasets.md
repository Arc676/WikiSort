# WikiSort datasets

The data included in the repository was generated by timing the execution of sorting algorithms on arrays.

| ID.ods |  This test, which used random data, shows that on the x86 Intel i7 chip in a mid-2012 MacBook Pro, double comparison turns out to be faster than integer comparison. The integer and double lists contained elements with the same integral portion. The elements in the double list also included two decimal places. |
| IHQ.ods, IHQ 2.ods | This test used random data and compared the runtime of introsort, heapsort, and quicksort. The introsort algorithm uses both the two other sorting algorithms' techniques. The data shows that heapsort is much slower for large data sets while introsort isn't much faster than quicksort. |
